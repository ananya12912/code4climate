## Few things before we start
This file and the README file and many other files in this repository will be written using _markdown_. You can think markdown as a simple text-based tool to organize thoughts!

It is recommended that you try using markdown yourself, too. At least for this program. And see if you like it.

To get you started, [here's a cheatsheet on Markdown (md)](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

Ananya: codespace didn't work

print ('Hello World')
print("what is the weather like?")

name=input("what is your name? \n")\

print("Hello!",name)

a = 40
b = 100

if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
  
def main():
	x,y =8,4
	
	if(x < y):
		st= "x is less than y"
	else:
		st= "x is greater than y"
	print (st)
	
if __name__ == "__main__":
	main()
